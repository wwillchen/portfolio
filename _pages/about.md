Hey there! I'm an undergraduate student @ Duke. I am currently a research assistant in theoretical reinforcement learning advised by Prof. Mo Liu, Prof. Weitong Zhang, and Prof. Pan Xu. I also worked on robotics projects under Prof. Ron Parr.

In the past, I worked as a [Imagine Cup Student](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/student-developer-blog/announcing-the-2024-imagine-cup-semifinalists/ba-p/4066101) at Microsoft on an AI story book project and a Data Science Intern at VR Business Brokers.
